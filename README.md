# Blaseball_Lo-fi_Mills
A css theme for the website https://www.blaseball.com/ changing it appearance to match the colors of the New York Millennials 

# Known issues
-I only worked a few hours on this and kinda butchered the original css, it was only tested on Chrome and might not look great on other browsers
-the icon on the navigation bar will move to the middle and on front of the navigation menu if you play with the window small enough that the entire menu is a dropdown, might fix that later
