# Blaseball_Lo-fi_Mills
A css theme for the website https://www.blaseball.com/ changing it appearance to match the colors of the New York Millennials.
Made using visual elements from the team website https://www.nymillennials.rocks/ and the team page https://blaseball.fandom.com/wiki/New_York_Millennials 

# How to install
Use Stylus or any other extension that allows you to run a custom .css file then copy/paste the content of Mills_Lofi.css into the extension (you'll probably need to create a new preset for the blaseball website).


# Known issues
-I only worked a few hours on this and kinda butchered the original css, it was only tested on Chrome and might not look great on other browsers
-the icon on the navigation bar will move to the middle and on front of the navigation menu if you play with the window small enough that the entire menu is a dropdown, might fix that later
